# Tools:
 - Build tool: Angular CLI
 - SPA Framework: Angular 5
 - UI Framework: Angular Material
 - Data Visulization Framework: D3.js
 - Data Flow: @ngrx/store, @ngrx/effects, RxJs

# Performance consideration:
 - Progressive Web App philosophy (Service Worker)
 - Used associative array for faster and partial data update
 - Requested data in chunks to ensure optimize the http traffic

# Development consideration:
 - Modular, single source of truth, SRP, LIFT (Locate quickly, Identify at a glance, Flat structure, and Try to be DRY)
 - Unit Tests (critical cases only)
